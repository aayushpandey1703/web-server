## git notes
1. install git version control system from git-scm.com 
2. git is used to track files by creating savepoints of prev versions of app
3. to start git in app use 'git init' cmd that will create .git folder (inorder change visibility of .git foler follow "File->preferences->settings
     scroll down and navigate to file:exclude section")
4. use 'git status' cmd to see untracked files list

6. use 'git add .' cmd to add all untracked files to staged area and then use 'git commit -m "[description]"' cmd commit changes made and create a savepoints

## github deployment from git
0. open git bash and navigate to project directory like 'F:\Node.js projects\web-server'

2. create a new repo at github
3. git remote add origin git@github.com:aayushpandey1703/test.git
4. git branch -M main
5. git push -u origin main
6. if github repo already created then instead of "git push -u origin main" use git "push -u origin main --force" as first push cmd everytime 
7. "git push" cmd afterwards to update changes at github 
8. inorder to check whether remote origin is created at project folder or not use "git remote -v" at project root directory
